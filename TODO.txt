(1) Run AES on the device and see how we get the EM emission patterns.

    openssl aes-256-cbc -in message.txt -out ciphertext.aes -pass pass:asanka

    openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in ciphertext.aes -out decrypted.txt -pass pass:asanka

(2) Collect data using the GNURadio script on the host computer. (Don't use the shellscript which utilize hackrf_transfer command underneath. It doesn't provide the flexibility of the GNURadio modules.)
